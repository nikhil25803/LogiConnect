# LogiConnect
 Implementation of a highly scalable logistics platform that
 enables users to book transportation services for moving goods. The platform connects users with a
 fleet of drivers, offering real-time availability, pricing, and tracking.

 The system is engineered to handle up to 10,000 requests per second, catering to a global user base
 of 50 million and supporting 100,000 registered drivers. This project is a submission for the
 On-Demand Logistics Platform for Goods Transportation, focusing on efficient coordination and
 high-performance capabilities
